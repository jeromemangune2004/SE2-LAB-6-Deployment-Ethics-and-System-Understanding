Ethics Reflection
1. Why is mental health data sensitive?
Mental health data is private because it shows how a person feels inside. If this information is leaked, it could cause the person to feel ashamed or even be treated unfairly by others.

2. Ethical risks of AI wellness apps
The biggest risks are hackers stealing private data and the app giving wrong or bad advice. There is also a worry that companies might sell this personal information to make money without the user's permission.

3. How to protect user data
We can protect data by using encryption to lock it and requiring passwords so only the right people can see it. Developers should also only collect the information that is truly needed.

4. Improvements for production
To make the app professional and safe, I would:

Hide Secret Keys: Use special files (.env) to keep the database and API addresses secret.

Strict Security: Set up the server so it only talks to my specific website (CORS).

Add Login: Make sure users have to log in to see their own data.

Better Checks: Make sure the app checks all user input to prevent hackers from breaking the system.
